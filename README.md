Tableau Viz Dashboard

Open Sourcing Mental Health (formerly OSMI) is a non-profit corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open-source communities.

Currently over 1400 responses, the ongoing 2016 survey aims to measure attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace, and examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers.
